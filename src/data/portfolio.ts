  intro:
    "I'm Aditya Kumar Jha, a Computer Science & Engineering student who enjoys building digital products, solving problems, exploring AI, working with data, and turning ideas into useful experiences. I actively take on hackathons, internships, and independent projects to build scalable, real-world technology.",
  bio: "I'm a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a deep interest in turning complex problems into clean, working software. My focus spans Data Analytics, AI/ML, and full-stack Web Development — I like understanding a problem fully before I touch the keyboard, and I care about writing code that's still readable six months later. Outside of coursework, I compete in hackathons, work through competitive programming problems, and take on internships that put theory into production.",
